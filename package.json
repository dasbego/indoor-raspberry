  "description": "The project contains 3 components: 1) Sensor reader: \tPython script to be run in the Raspberry. This script makes use of: \t- DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor \t- Arduino Uno: Which is providing analogic data from 2x YL-69 soild humidity sensors \tThis can be extended to support other digital sensors only. 2) API: A Flask API that makes use of Firebase Databases to manage: \t- Plants CRUD: add new plants to the indoor house \t- Plants records: adding new records from plants information containing humidity in each plant. And fetching of plant specific records 3) Arduino program: \tAllows to configure both digital and analogic sensors and send them via serial to the raspberry. \tIt currently reads 2x YL-69 sensors that are connected to 2 different pots in the indoor house.",
